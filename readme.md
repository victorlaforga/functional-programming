## War&WeaponTreasures

In this course we are going to visualize data from the NMVW. The main goal is to make a concept which also can visually be presented in reality.

###Concept

For the concept we had the choice to make an application for Rik, or do something with Geo locations. I chose to make a concept for Rik because in my opinion geo location is already a variable which is very general.

First I started off searching for objects that were interesting to watch and interact.

My concept is called War&WeaponTreasures. I want the user to see the different lengths of the objects, and compare it with objects that we use or see daily. I'm gonna use 3 different categories: weapons, fight and war.
